[KOLs Online](https://newkolscan.io) is a Solana wallet tracker designed to monitor the activities of top memecoin traders and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in real time. It offers a range of features, including tracking real-time trades, providing insights into wallet holdings and Token Profit and Loss (PnL), and featuring a leaderboard that ranks traders based on their realized PnL.

KOLs Online offers both free and premium features. Real-time trades are accessible for free, while real-time token tracking is available for wallets holding 100,000 or more KOLs Online tokens. The platform allows users to track any wallet address, though initial data is limited to the last 100 transactions unless more data is loaded.

To get a wallet featured on the leaderboard, users need to have at least 10,000 followers on Twitter or a monthly PnL exceeding $200,000. They can apply by sending a direct message to [@KOLs Online on Twitter](https://twitter.com/newKOLs Online).
